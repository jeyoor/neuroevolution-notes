Final Project Proposal
====

PongOut: Competitive Paddleball
----

* Base Phase
    * Upgrade the Breakout game to support competitive play between 2 human players (I'm envisioning vertical Pong)
    * Implement a simple "ball-chasing" agent to stand in as the second player
* Stretch Goals
    * Create a neuroevolution agent to play against the linear "ball-chaser"
    * Implement a 0 players mode where you can watch the neuroevolution agent evolve better strategies
